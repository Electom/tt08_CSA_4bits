## How it works

This is a 4-bit CLA. It can be used to construct the adder with higher bit.

## How to test

The design has 3 input ports: a, b and ci
It has 2 output ports: s and co
a: an addend.
b: the other addend.
ci: the carry signal for the input.
s: the output sum.
co: the carry signal for the output.

## External hardware

This project was tested by an U250 FPGA.
